# Introduction to ARIA

Since I work for a public website, the produced HTML must be at the bery least ARIA friendly (as opposed to fully ARIA-compatible).

The big problem with ARIA is that you must memorize sane but numerous default behavior to know where you must add the ARIA attribute and where adding one will only clutter your code.

To do so, I will study the following resources :
